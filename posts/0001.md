# Jumping into Front End development 

(after doing Backend devlopment for a while)

Oh boy, I jumped in the deep end with that thought and boy, did I learn a lot about Front End Dev. 

## Problem 1 - Actually creating a React App

How hard could it be?  Just create a React application and viola! ...Right?

It's not actually that simple.

Create React App or CRA for short, has been a little [dead in the water](https://github.com/reactjs/react.dev/pull/5487#issuecomment-1409720741) for a little while. So, starting a new project in React requires you choose from four frameworks: 

* NextJS maintained by Vercel
* Remix maintained by Shopify
* GatsbyJS maintained by Netlify
* Expo (for native apps) maintained by Expo

I originally wanted to have a look at Remix since that's more similar to the React I'm used to but the `npx create-remix` command was broken so I decided to have a look at NextJS instead.

## Problem 2 - How do I create two site pages and navigate between each other

As of writing, NextJS uses an app router.  What that means is that if you create a page.jsx under the app folder or use the one it creates, it will automatically create a route.  This will be your home page "/"

```
app
|
--> page.tsx

```js
const HomePage = () => {
  return <h1>Home Page</h1>
}

export default HomePage();
```
